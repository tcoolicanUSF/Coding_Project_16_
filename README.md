# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Scenario: A small e-commerce business wants to build a simple Product Dashboard to manage its product listings. The dashboard should display a list of products, each with a name, price, and description. The business also wants a way to add new products. By organizing the interface into React components, the business can maintain and update the dashboard as the product line grows.
